# voc2coco For [CenterNet](https://github.com/Duankaiwen/CenterNet)

> Original Code from https://github.com/yukkyo/voc2coco
 
### Convert VOC xml annotations to COCO json annotations. 

- Made few alterations in voc2coco.py to produce COCO annotations tailored to CenterNet. 

- To run the script, check out the original code above, it is exactly the same but for ```--labels``` the nargs required are 2 not 1. label.txt and labelid.txt must be inserted here. Check out the label.txt/labelid.txt and make alterations for your own usage.
